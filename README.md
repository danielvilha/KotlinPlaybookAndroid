# Kotlin Playbook Android
Developed as a challenge project: https://github.com/Babylonpartners/android-playbook/blob/master/recruitment/code_challenge.md

The app should have two screens, as follows:

- A screen with a list of clickable posts with at least the post title
- A detail screen for the selected post with at least the follow:
  - Post title
  - Post body
  - Author name
  - Number of comments
  
You can fetch all the required data from the following API endpoints:
- GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users 
- GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments 

Feel free to add more things to the app using the other available APIs or https://api.adorable.io/avatars to generate a random avatar for the posts authors.
